**Note:** This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [Kaggle Adult Income in the United States](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielbethell/adult-incomes-in-the-united-states). This repository is a class exercise that focuses on reproducibility of research, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io). 

The focus of our exploration and analysis was discovering different relationships amongst demographic information about those residing in the United States.
